### This is what a gel looks like if your extracted DNA had residual ethanol from the extraction method in it. When adding the sample to the wells, it doesn't stay in the wells of the gel and goes into the buffer. If you run the gel then some of the floated up sample gets run in a different well, which you can tell in this gel where the 5th/6th well had no sample added to it but a DNA smear is see.
