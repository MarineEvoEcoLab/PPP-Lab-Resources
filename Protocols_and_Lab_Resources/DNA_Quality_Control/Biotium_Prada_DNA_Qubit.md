# Biotium Broad Range DNA Qubit Assay Protocol

For assessing the concentration of DNA
Prada Lab

**Materials**

- Biotium Buffer and Standards
- Thin-walled Qubit Assay Tubes
- Black rectangle tube rack

**Steps**

1. Set the box of reagents (blue on the middle shelf in the fridge) 30-60 minutes prior to use. The reagents need to come to room temperature before use
2. Thaw DNA samples if frozen, keep on an ice bucket
3. Set up 2 thin-walled Qubit tubes and label as S1 and S2, using the underside of the black rack
4. Set up 1 thin-walled Qubit tube per sample, and label with the sample number/name
5. Add 190ul of the Biotium buffer to each tube (standard and sample tubes)
6. Add 10ul of standard 1 to the S1 tube
7. Add 10ul of standard 2 to the S2 tube
8. Add 1ul of your first sample to their corresponding Qubit assay tube
9. Add 1ul of the rest of your samples to their corresponding tubes
10. Take tubes and rack to the Qubit station
11. Vortex and spin down all tubes to mix
12. Let tubes sit in the rack for 1-2 minutes to incubate
13. Create a table in your notebook for recording the standards and the concentrations
14. On the Qubit, make sure you are on the home screen
15. Tap for ds DNA, and broad range
16. Select Read Standards
17. Put in the S1 tube and read standard 1
18. Record the value
19. Put in the S2 tube and read standard 2
20. Record the value
21. Click read samples
22. Make sure the setting are for 1ul input volume and ng/ul output reading
23. Put in the first sample and read, and record the value in your notebook
24. Repeat for each sample
25. Go back through each sample again in order, to get two readings per sample. If there is a difference that is more than 1 significant figure, you may need to try again. Ex: if your first reading was 43.5 and the next was 43.8, that is fine. However if the first reading was 43.5 and the next was 50, you may want to re-make everything.
26. The used qubit tubes are completely safe to be disposed of in the trash
27. Take the average of the two Qubit readings as your final reading
28. Report all readings in your spreadsheet for the project
