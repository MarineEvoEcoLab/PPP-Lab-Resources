Last updated 20210617 MES

**Steps**

- DNA standardization
- PCR amplification of fragment
- Validation of fragment with gel electrophoresis

**Materials and Equipment**

- Extracted fish DNA
- D-Loop primers at 10uM concentration:
  - L15995 (forward)
  - H16498 (reverse)
- MyTaq Bioline PCR master mix
- Molecular grade water
- 8 strip PCR tubes
- P20, p200, and p1000 tips and pipettes
- Vortexer
- Bench centrifuge
- Thermocycler
- Agarose
- Gel box, power station, and imager
- GeneRuler 1kb plus DNA ladder

**Protocol**

**DNA Concentration Standardization**

- Make a dilution for all samples where the concentration is 10ng/ul. This way each sample is standardized going into the PCR (not all samples need to be diluted at once, it depends on how many samples you&#39;ll do at a time for the PCR)
- Calculate the volume of extracted DNA per sample that is needed for 200ng each. Equation: 200/extracted DNA ng/ul = volume for 200ng
- Subtract that volume from 20 to get the volume of molecular grade water to equal 20ul. 200ng DNA in 20ul means that the concentration is 20ng/ul for each sample

| **Sample #** | **Avg QC reading** | **ul for 200ng** | **ul up to 20ul** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 63.4 | 3.2 | 16.8 |
| 8 | 37.9 | 5.3 | 14.7 |
| 14 | 33.5 | 6.0 | 14.0 |
| 17 | 70.6 | 2.8 | 17.2 |
| 65 | 30.6 | 6.5 | 13.5 |

- Print out the table and tape it into your lab notebook
- Thaw the DNA samples you&#39;re going to use on ice, and once they are thawed vortex them for 4 seconds and spin them down quickly in the bench top centrifuge
- Keep the samples on ice while in use
- Label strip tubes for each sample with the sample number and &quot;dil&quot; for dilution
- Add the calculated amount of molecular grade water first to each strip tube, highlighting off each value as you add it to increase accuracy
- Place the strip tubes on ice (in a rack helps)
- Add the calculated amount of DNA to its respective dilution tube, highlighting off each value as you add it to increase accuracy
- Vortex and spin down the strip tubes and keep on ice
- Put the DNA samples back into the -20 freezer

**D-Loop PCR Amplification**

- Thaw the D-Loop L15995 and H16498 **10uM** primers on ice (make sure the tubes say 10uM)
- Thaw Bioline MyTaq PCR Mix on ice
- Calculate the amount of &quot;master mix&quot; to make for all your samples. First, determine the _n_ number: number of samples + 1 for negative control + 5% for error. For example, if you have 10 samples plus 1 for the negative control, the addition for error is 0.55 (11\*0.05), so the _n_ number would be 11.55. Then multiply the components of the master mix by the end number to get the volume needed for the master mix:
  - 6.25ul of Bioline MyTaq mix \* _n_ = X ul of Bioline MyTaq mix
  - 3.25ul of molecular grade water \* _n_ = X ul of molecular grade water
  - 1ul of 10uM L15995 primer \* _n_ = X ul of L15995 primer
  - 1ul of 10uM H16498 primer \* _n_ = X ul of H16498 primer
- Label a new 2mL or smaller tube for making the master mix and keep on ice
- Vortex and spin down the Bioline after it has thawed. Add the calculated amount of Bioline mix to the master mix tube
- Add the calculated amount of molecular grade water to the master mix tube
- Vortex and spin down the L15995 primer after it has thawed. Add the calculated amount of L15995 primer to the master mix tube
- Vortex and spin down the H16498 primer after it has thawed. Add the calculated amount of H16498 primer to the master mix tube
- Vortex and spin down the master mix tube and keep on ice
- Label new strip tubes for each of your samples plus one extra tube for the negative control. Keep tubes on a rack in ice, these are for PCR
- Add 11.5ul of master mix to each of the PCR strip tubes
- Add 1ul of 10ng/ul diluted DNA to their respective PCR strip tubes
- Add 1ul of molecular grade water to the negative control tube
- Vortex and spin down the PCR strip tubes. Each tube should have master mix and DNA from one sample (except for the negative control tube that has water)
- Turn on the thermocycler with the switch in the back left corner and wait for it to warm up. Login to CP with the pin 2018
- Open the lid of the thermocycler and put in the PCR strip tubes. Put in extra blank strip tubes in the thermocycler to &quot;balance&quot; the area
- Close the lid of the thermocycler and navigate to the D-Loop PCR program. Press start to begin the program (not enter). The program goes for 2 hours and 15 minutes
- After the program is finished, either freeze the PCR product at -20, put in the fridge (temporarily), or put on ice for an immediate gel

**Gel Size Validation**

- Thaw the PCR product on ice if you had frozen it, otherwise keep it on an ice bucket
- Add 12.5ul of molecular grade water to each PCR product (reduces concentration in the gel so you have a clearer band)
- Make a 1% gel in whatever size gel you need (see gel protocol)
- Follow the gel protocol to set up and make a gel
- Use the GeneRuler 1kb plus DNA ladder
- Freeze the PCR product at -20 when finished
- For clearest results, run the gel at 90V for 1.5 hours
- Expected band size should be at 400bp. There should be no band in the negative control. If there is glow/smear below the 75bp mark that is left over primer and is supposed to show up on the gel
- Example gel:
