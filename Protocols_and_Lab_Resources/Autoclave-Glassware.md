# Autoclave Protocol for Empty Glassware

1. Use the autoclave-safe bins, they are opaque white and are stacked on the shared shelf above the equipment bench
2. Put autoclave tape on each of your glasswares, doesn't need a lot
3. Arrange glassware in tubs where each piece isn't touching the one next to it and there is equal space between pieces. At least and inch separating things is best
4. If you're the first one to use the autoclave in the day then you need to flush it first. The screen will tell you if you need to do this.
5. If you need to flush, use the key on the upper left side of the unit. Turn the key and pull out the whole front side of the unit, you can grab the side of the steel panel to jerk it off
6. On the inside there is an orange valve at the bottom of the unit. Turn it to fully open so that when you flush the steam and water comes out
7. **Once the valve is opened** you can close the unit and press flush on the screen
8. It will count down until it's done flushing
9. Once it's done flushing you will have to open the front of the unit and close the valve again, close the front and push it in until it is secure. Then you can open the door and load in your items. Press the pedal at the bottom of the unit on the right side. This should open the door automatically
10. Load in your bins, you should be able to put in two bins, and you can roll out the rack if needed
11. To close the door you press the same pedal, if the door doesn't go up automatically you can help it get started (sometimes it gets stuck) by pulling up on the little handle
12. On the panel chose the correct protocol. For dry glassware you want to use a "Gravity" setting. The longest one is #6
13. Once it's started make not of how long it should take, come back a few minutes after it's done so it cooled down a bit before you open it. Use the orange gloves when taking your items out. Open with the pedal and take out the bins
14. Make sure to close the door when you're done

### Note: Don't start a cycle where it will end after 5pm. The machine is on a timer for the building and will alarm if it is still running after 5pm. Yes this is silly but that's how it is.
