# [Circulomics Nanobind Big DNA Kit](https://www.circulomics.com/store/Nanobind-Tissue-Big-DNA-Kit-p129187130) HMW DNA Extraction Protocol. This uses the recomendations from the [Snail Note](https://15a13b02-7dac-4315-baa5-b3ced1ea969d.filesusr.com/ugd/5518db_49ee69b3459c44abab7f7287e8da499e.pdf?index=true) and there is the additional step of the [Short Read Eliminator XL Kit](https://www.circulomics.com/store/Short-Read-Eliminator-XL-p138401730) to remove smaller fragments

#### Note that this extraction method has only been used with reagents from the Alpha version of this kit. Reagents now sold with this kit may be different

#### Use wide-bore pipette tips when working with HMW DNA. Avoid pipetting the DNA as much as possible and never vortex the DNA. You should also use "DNA lo-bind" tubes. Never freeze HMW DNA, keep in the fridge for storage.

## Sample Prep. Use a glass dounce for homoginization

- Place dounce homogenizer, buffer CIB (same as CT), and your sample(s)
- While waiting for sample(s) to thaw set the centrifuge for 4 degrees C and let run for 7 minutes to bring the temp down
- Sterilze disection material needed with 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% ethanol
- Cut or chip ~60mg of tissue/sample
- Place tissue in the chilled dounce and
- Add 750µl of  cold buffer CIB to the dounce
- Homogenize tissue by pushing with the tight pestle 15-20 times up and down the glass outside container. If there are ossicles or skeleton, this won't break down but the soft tissue will
- Transfer liquid and as much of the bubbles as possible to a 2mL protein lobind tube
- Centrifuge protein lobind tube at 6000rcf for 5 minutes at 4 degrees C
- After centrifugation, remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet
- Add 1mL of cold buffer CIB to the tube and pulse-vortex 10 times
- Centrifuge at 6000rcf for 5 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet
- Pulse-vortex the pellet 2 times
- Add 20µl of proteinase K to the pellet
- Add 150µl of buffer CLE3 and pipette-mix 10 times with a wide bore pipette tip
- Put tube in Thermomixer 55 degrees C 900rpm shaking for 30 minutes
- After 30 minutes check homogenization: you should see no visible chunks
- Spin down in minifuge to remove liquid from cap
- Add 20µl RNase A
- Incubate in Thermomixer 55 degrees C 900rpm shaking for 30 minutes

### Extraction

- Spin down in minifuge to remove liquid from cap
- Add 60µl buffer SB and pulse-vortex 5 times  _liquid can become white here_
- Centrifuge 10,000rcf for 5 minutes at room temp
- Transfer ~300µl supernatant to a new 1.5mL lobind protein tube _Don't take the pellet and discard tube_
- Add 50µl buffer BL3 to tube with supernatant and invert 10 times to mix _liquid can become cloudy with mixing_
- Spin on minifuge 2 seconds
- Add 1 nanobind disk
- Add 350µl of 100% isopropanol
- Invert to mix 10 times _liquid goes clear after mixing_
- Place on orbital mixer/shaker 15 minutes at **20rpm** at room temp
- Place tube on magnet using method:

- Carefully remove and discarded supernatant
- While on magnet add 500µl CW1
- Remove tube from magnet and invert 4 times
- Place tube back on magnet using method
- Remove and discard supernatant
- While on magnet add 500µl CW1
- Remove tube from magnet and invert 4 times
- Place tube back on magnet using method
- Remove and discard supernatant
- While on magnet add 500µl CW2
- Remove tube from magnet and invert 4 times
- Place tube back on magnet using method
- Remove and discard supernatant
- While on magnet add 500µl CW2
- Remove tube from magnet and invert 4 times
- Placed tube back on magnet using method
- Remove and discard supernatant
- Pipette out residual liquid from the tube cap
- Spin down tube in minifuge
- Placed on magnet in normal way
- Remove and discard any residual liquid
- Take tube of magnet
- Add 75µl buffer EB directly to the disk _disk should be fully submerged in the buffer_
- Incubate at room temp for 30 minutes
- Use wide bore tip to transfer liquid to a new 1.5mL DNA lo bind tube
- Spin down tube with disk in minifuge and pipette up residual elutate with regular pipette tip
- Spin down tube with disk again to check for any residual liquid
- Pipette mix DNA in new 1.5mL tube 5 times with normal p200 pipette tip
- Leave new 1.5mL tube overnight at RT to let DNA solubilize
- The next day: pipette 5 times with normal p200 tip
- **Store in fridge when not in use**

**Use tapestation results to determine if you want to use the short read eliminator kit. It will remove shorter fragments but you will also have a loss of total DNA**

## Short Read Eliminator XL Kit

- Transfer 60µl of sample from extraction to a new DNA Lo bind 1.5mL tube
- Add 60µl buffer SRE XL with a wide bore tip and pipetted to mix ~7 times then tap a bit if not mixed enough
- Place in centrifuge with tube hinge facing the outside
- Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 10,000rcf at room temp
- Make fresh 80% EtOH and warmed elution buffer to 50 degrees C
- After centrifugation, remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet _the pellet may be very very hard to see_
- Add 200µl 80% EtOH to the side of the tube without touching the pellet
- Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10,000rcf RT
- Remove wash without disturbing the pellet
- Add 200µl 80% EtOH to the side of the tube without touching the pellet
- Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10,000rcf RT
- Remove wash and any residual droplets
- Add 50µl warmed buffer EB and placed tube in thermomixer at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes
- Tap tube a few times to redistributed DNA
- Store in fridge when not in use
