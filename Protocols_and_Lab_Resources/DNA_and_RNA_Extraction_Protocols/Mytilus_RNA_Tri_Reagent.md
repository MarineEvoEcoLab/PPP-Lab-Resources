# Mytilus Fresh Tissue (and RNA Later Preserved) Tri-Reagent RNA Extraction Protocol

**Adjusted Tri-Reagent/Direct-zol RNA Isolation Protocol written by [Johanna Harvey](https://github.com/JAHarvey), with the [Zymo Research Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/direct-zol_rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)**

#### NOTE: Almost all steps are done in the hood, with safety glasses, gloves, and lab coat. All solid waste goes into a ziploc bag with a hazard label

### Protocol

1. Aliquot [_n_ * 1] mL of Tri-Reagent (stored in 4 degree fridge) into a 5mL tube and keep in and ice bucket (need 1mL per sample, _n_ is the number of samples)
2. Aliquot [_n_*100] µl of 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane (stored in the acid cabinet) into a 1.5mL tube and keep in and ice bucket (need 100ul per sample)
3. **For live mussels** Clean RNA bench-top and a new piece of foil with 10% bleach, DI H20, 70% EtOH, then RNaseZap. Do this cleaning step between mussels
5. **For live mussels** Clean RNA bench forceps and scalpel with DI water, 70% EtoH, RNaseZap, then Nuclease free H20 for each mussel
6. **For live mussels** Use fresh scalpel blade and cut open mussel through their hinge and around the slit between the two shells until you can pull apart
7. **For live mussels** Take a few millimeter section of tissue from the mantle and lightly chop with the scalpel blade and place in a new 1.5mL tube (empty)
8. **For Tissue in RNA Later** Clean RNA bench forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% EtoH, RNaseZap, then Nuclease free H20 for each mussel
9. **For Tissue in RNA Later** Make a rinse 1.5mL tube with 500ul nuclease free water
10. **For Tissue in RNA Later** Use forceps to take the tissue piece, dunk/rinse the tissue piece in the nuclease water 3 times, and transfer to new 1.5mL tubes. Repeat this for every sample
8. **For all sample types, immediately after placing in the 1.5mL tube, one at a time** Add 1mL of Tri-Reagent to each sample **IN THE HOOD**
9. Add homogenization beads such as [x](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152) to each 1.5mL tube in the hood
10. Vortex all samples **in the hood** for the same amount of time, until all the tissue is broken up. ~1minute
11. Aspirate all liquid into a new 1.5mL tube per sample
12. Waste tubes and tips are disposed of in a bag in the hood for hazardous waste
13. Add 100µl of cold 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane to each sample tube and tubes are inverted repeatedly for at least 20 seconds. _The liquid should look like pepto-bismol_
14. Incubate tubes at room temp in the hood for 15 minutes
15. At this time turn on the centrifuge, set it for 2 degrees C and let it spin to get cooling down
16. Centrifugation separates out the aqueous layer (with RNA) and the organic layer. Before centrifugation some separation of layers can be already present
17. Centrifug all samples at maximum speed for 30 minutes at 2 degrees C
18. Very carefully take the sample tubes out of the centrifuge as to not disturb the layers, and take back to the hood
19. With a p200 pipette, remove ~500µl of the clear supernatant and put it in a new 1.5mL tube for each sample
20. The remaining liquid can be stored in the -80 for potential DNA extraction or put in the hazardous waste bag
21. Add equal volume (~500µl) of 100% EtOH to the new sample tubes and inverted to mix
22. Transfer 500µl of the liquid into spin columns from the [Direct-zol kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/direct-zol_rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) for each sample
23. Centrifuge spin columns at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds at room temp
24. Transfer spin columns to new collection tubes, discard the flow through in a tri-reagent liquid hazardous waste container and the tubes in the solid waste hazardous bag
25. Add the other 500µl of sample, and repeated the spin _after each spin samples were moved to new collection tubes_
25. Add 400µl of RNA Wash Buffer to the spin columns
26. Centrifuge spin columns for 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
26. Calculated volumes for DNase I treatment:
    - 75µl DNA Digestion buffer x _n_
    - 5µl DNase I x _n_
27. Add 80µl of DNase I treatment master mix directly to the filter of each spin column
28. Begin warming Nuclease-free H20 in a thermomixer to 70 degrees C (need 100ul per sample)
29. Add 400µl of RNA Pre-Wash buffer to each column
30. Centrifuge spin columns at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
30. Repeated the two steps above
31. Add 700µl of RNA Wash Buffer
32. Centrifuge spin columns at 16,000 rcf for two minutes
32. Transfer spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes (final tubes)
33. Add 50µl of warmed Nuclease-free H20 directly to the filter of the spin column
34. Incubate columns at room temp for 5 minutes
34. Centrifuge columns at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
35. Repeated addition of H20, incubation, and spin
36. Aliquot 5µl of RNA for Qubit and TapeStation analysis in strip tubes
37. Label 1.5mL tubes stored in -80 (if not labeled already)
38. [Qubit RNA analysis](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md)
39. [TapeStation RNA analysis](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/RNA_Quality_Control/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol.md)
