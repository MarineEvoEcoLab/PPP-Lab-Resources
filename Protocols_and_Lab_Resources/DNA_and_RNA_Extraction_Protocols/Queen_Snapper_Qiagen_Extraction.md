## Protocol

**Tissue Digestion**

1. Randomly select and even number of tissues to do for the day
2. Half-thaw samples on an ice bucket
3. Cut 3-4 inch square pieces of foil, one for each sample

4. Rinse forceps and scissors with: 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% ethanol in that order
5. Set up one 2 or 1.5mL tube per sample with the sample number on the lid
6. Add 360ul buffer ATL to each 2 or 1.5mL tube
7. Wipe a foil piece with 10% bleach then DI water
8. Take out a tissue piece with the forceps and lay on the foil (it is easier to take out of the tube when half-frozen instead of fully thawed)
9. Use the scissors to cut a few-cm sized piece from the larger piece ![](RackMultipart20210809-4-1haxsup_html_615c67fdde84a7a3.jpg)
10. Put the big piece back into the sample tube and place on ice
11. Use the scissors to snip the small tissue piece into smaller pieces, almost like you are mincing it
12. Use the forceps to place the minced tissue into the corresponding 2 or 1.5mL tube with ATL labeled for that sample
13. Wipe the forceps and scissors with a kimwipe if there is remaining tissue on them
14. Rinse forceps and scissors with: 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% ethanol in that order
15. Place used foil piece in the waste bucket
16. Repeat steps 7-15 for all other tissue samples
17. Add 40ul of proteinase K to each 2 or 1.5mL tube with tissue
18. Vortex and spin down the 2/1.5mL tubes
19. Place the 2/1.5mL tubes in the thermomixer at 56 degrees C shaking at 800rpm for 1-2 hours. The tissue should completely dissolve in that time
20. Place 4mL sample tubes back into the freezer

**Column DNA Purification**

1. Make a 2/1.5mL tube with buffer AE in it, calculate how much buffer you will need. Each sample needs 100ul of buffer AE. Add in some extra volume to account for evaporation. For example, for 9 samples, 900ul is needed. For extra add another 100ul and add 1mL to the 2/1.5mL tube
2. Place the AE tube in the thermomixer at 56 degrees C, no shaking
3. Make new 2/1.5mL tubes per sample. These are the final tubes. Write the sample number and &quot;DNA&quot; on the lid. On the side of the tube write the sample number, &quot;DNA&quot;, &quot;Snapper&quot;, the date, and your initials. Set aside these tubes until the end of the extraction
4. Vortex and spin down the sample tubes after incubation
5. Add 400ul buffer AL to the first tube
6. Vortex that tube for 5 seconds
7. Continue adding 400ul buffer AL to each tube, vortexing the tubes after each addition
8. Add 400ul 100% ethanol to the first tube
9. Vortex that tube for 5 seconds
10. Continue adding 400ul 100% ethanol to each tube, vortexing the tubes after each addition
11. A white precipitate may form in the tubes, this is not an issue, make sure to vortex those tubes thoroughly
12. Spin down sample tubes
13. Set up a spin column and collection tube (packed together) for each sample and label with the sample number
14. Add 600ul of the liquid from the sample tubes to their corresponding spin columns
15. Centrifuge the spin columns at 10,000rcf for 1 minute, making sure to balance the samples
16. Pour off the flow through into a waste beaker from the sink (to be used for hazardous waste collection)
17. Return the spin columns to their collection tubes
18. Add the remaining 600ul from the sample tubes to their corresponding spun columns
19. Centrifuge the spin columns at 10,000rcf for 1 minute
20. Set up 1 new collection tube per sample
21. Transfer the spin columns to new collection tubes
22. Pour off the flow through into the waste beaker and discard the old collection tube
23. Add 500ul of buffer AW1 to each spin column
24. Centrifuge the spin columns at 10,000rcf for 1 minute
25. Set up 1 new collection tube per sample
26. Transfer the spin columns to new collection tubes
27. Pour off the flow through into the waste beaker and discard the old collection tube
28. Add 500ul of buffer AW2 to each spin column
29. Centrifuge the spin columns at 20,000rcf for 3 minutes
30. Transfer the spin columns to the final 2/1.5mL tubes that you made in step three
31. Pour off the flow through into the waste beaker and discard the old collection tube
32. Add 50ul of warmed buffer AE to each spin column by dripping the liquid onto the filter without touching the filter with your pipette tip
33. Incubate the columns at room temp on the bench for 5 minutes
34. Centrifuge the spin columns at 10,000rcf for 1 minute
35. Repeat steps 32-34 one more time for a second elution
36. Discard the spin columns
37. Set up strip tubes and label with the sample number
38. Vortex and spin down the final sample tubes
39. Aliquot 8ul of the liquid in the final tubes (extracted DNA) into their corresponding strip tube for QC analysis
40. Freeze the final tubes at -20 degrees C
41. If QCing immediately, the strip tubes can be kept on an ice bucket. If QCing another day, freeze strip tubes at -20 degrees C
