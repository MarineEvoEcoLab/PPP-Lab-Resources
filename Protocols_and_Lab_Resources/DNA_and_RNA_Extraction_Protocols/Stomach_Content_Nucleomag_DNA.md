# DNA from Food NucleoMag Kit Extraction for Snapper Stomach Content Samples

[NucleoMag DNA from Food Macherey-Nagel 96 Prep Kit](https://www.mn-net.com/us/nucleomag-dna-food-kit-for-dna-purification-from-food-744945.4?c=5369)

Notes:

- The kit doesn&#39;t have any recommendations for how to homogenize the samples. Based off of the recommendations from the tissuelyser for DNA, I decided on 1 minute at 15Hz homogenization in the MN bead tube with the lysis buffer

- The time incubating in the thermomixer after homogenization can be longer than 30 minutes (section 7.1 of protocol) so I increased it to 1 hour because 30 minutes seemed very short

- I did not have any dye to test our orbital shaker speed, by testing on the samples the first time they needed to be on the shaker it seemed like 500rpm was the fastest speed for shaking before droplets formed up on the side of the tube. However, at this speed the NucleoMag beads do not mix completely by themselves and settle somewhat to the bottom of the tube.

**Steps:**

-  Add 550ul of buffer CF to one MN bead tubes per sample and placed in the thermomixer at 65 degrees C to warm up
- Thaw samples on an ice bucket
- Clean forceps with 10% bleach, type II DI water, and 70% ethanol in that order
- Use forceps to transfer a few mm piece of tissue from the first sample to a bead tube with warmed CF buffer
- Clean forceps between samples and add about the same size pieces of tissue to bead tubes for all samples
- Sample&#39;s tissue in bead tubes:

- Balance the tissuelyser with other bead tubes and ran the tissuelyser for 1 minute at 15Hz
- Samples should look well homogenized afterwards
- Samples after homogenization:

- Add 10ul of proteinase K to each bead tube
- Vortex each bead tube for 15 seconds and spin down
- Place bead tubes in the thermomixer for at least 1 hour at 65 degrees C and shaking at 800rpm
- Samples after incubation period:

- Transfer as much liquid as you can from the bead tubes to new 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuge the new 1.5mL tubes for 20 minutes at 5,600rcf
- Samples after centrifugation, they should have a small pellet but it can be hard to see:

- Transfer 400ul of supernatant from each tube to new 1.5mL tubes and discard the old tubes
- Resuspend NucleoMag beads with a quick vortex
- Add 25ul of NucleoMag beads to each of the new 1.5mL tubes
- Add 600ul of buffer CB to each of the new 1.5mL tubes
- Pipette mix each tube ~6 times until a homogenous mixture is achieved
- Place the tubes on the orbital shaker for 5 minutes at 500rpm, some of the NucleoMag beads will settle in the tube while shaking
- After the 5 minutes, place the tubes on a 1.5mL capable magnet rack
- Samples stay on the magnet rack for 5 minutes so all the NucleoMag beads can travel to the magnet
- After the 5 minutes, remove the supernatant slowly from each tube without disturbing the beads and discard in a hazardous waste beaker (for a bottle at the SSA to discard in later)
- Take the tubes off the magnet
- Add 600ul of buffer CMW to each tube and pipette mix ~6 times until homogenous
- Place the tubes on the orbital shaker for 3 minutes at 500rpm
- Place the tubes on the magnet rack for 3 minutes until all the NucleoMag beads go to the magnet
- Remove the supernatant slowly from each tube without disturbing the beads and discard in a hazardous waste beaker
- Take the tubes off the magnet
- Add 600ul of buffer CQW to each tube and pipette mix ~6 times until homogenous
- Place the tubes on the orbital shaker for 3 minutes at 500rpm
- Place the tubes on the magnet rack for 3 minutes until all the NucleoMag beads go to the magnet
- Remove the supernatant slowly from each tube without disturbing the beads and discard in a hazardous waste beaker
- Make Fresh 80% ethanol for however many samples you have (600ul 80% ethanol per sample), make with molecular grade water
- Take the tubes off the magnet
- Add 600ul of 80% ethanol to each tube and pipette mix ~6 times until homogenous
- Place the tubes on the orbital shaker for 3 minutes at 500rpm
- Place the tubes on the magnet rack for 3 minutes until all the NucleoMag beads go to the magnet
- Remove the supernatant slowly from each tube without disturbing the beads and discard in a hazardous waste beaker
- Leave the tubes to sit on the magnet with the lids open for 10 minutes to dry the beads
- Take the tubes off the magnet
- Add 50ul of buffer CE to each tube and pipette mix ~6 times to mix the beads
- Place the tubes on the orbital shaker for 5 minutes at 500rpm
- Place the tubes on the magnet rack for 3 minutes until all the NucleoMag beads go to the magnet
- Remove 50ul of supernatant from each tube into new labeled 1.5mL tubes and placed on ice as extracted DNA
- Save 8ul as an aliquot for QC
- Use the [Qubit to determine concentration](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Biotium_Prada_DNA_Qubit.md)
- Use a [1% gel to determine quality](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Agrose-Gel-Protocol.md)
