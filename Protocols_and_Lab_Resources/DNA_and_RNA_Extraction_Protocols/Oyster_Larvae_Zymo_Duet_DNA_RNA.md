## Zymo Duet Kit DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol : old protocol from 2018, incubation this long at 56 degrees no longer recommended with this kit


### Part 1: Digestion

**This step differs depending on the nature of how your samples were preserved/taken**

# Oyster Larvae

* Prepare 50mL conical tubes for each one of your samples (max 8 at a time suggested)
* Add 1000μl DNA/RNA sheild to each tube
* Prepare a new sterile scaple and blade
* Take filter out of the -80, briefly look to make an estimate of how much is on the top of the filter, and place over the opening to the conical tube
* Using the scalpel, cut the filter in at cross + then all around the edge so that triangles of filter fall into the tube _try to keep all ice chunks in the tube_
* Make sure all filter pieces are submerged in the DNA/RNA sheild
* Record the information from the whirl pak and the color of the filter in your notebook
* Repeat for each sample
* Add 100μl of PK digestion buffer to each conical tube
* Add 50μl of Proteinase K to each conical tube
* Vortex each sample and make sure the traingles of filter are submerged
* Put in incubator oven for 3 hours at 56°C rocking at speed 35. Every half hour vortex samples
*
