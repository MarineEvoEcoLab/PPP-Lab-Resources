## Zymo Duet Kit DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol : old protocol from 2018, incubation this long at 56 degrees no longer recommended with this kit


### Part 1: Digestion

**This step differs depending on the nature of how your samples were preserved/taken**

# Oyster Larvae

* Prepare 50mL conical tubes for each one of your samples (max 8 at a time suggested)
* Add 1000μl DNA/RNA shield to each tube
* Prepare a new sterile scalpel and blade
* Take filter out of the -80, briefly look to make an estimate of how much is on the top of the filter, and place over the opening to the conical tube
* Using the scalpel, cut the filter in at cross + then all around the edge so that triangles of filter fall into the tube _try to keep all ice chunks in the tube_
* Make sure all filter pieces are submerged in the DNA/RNA shield
* Record the information from the whirl pak and the color of the filter in your notebook
* Repeat for each sample
* Add 100μl of PK digestion buffer to each conical tube
* Add 50μl of Proteinase K to each conical tube
* Vortex each sample and make sure the triangles of filter are submerged
* Put in incubator oven for 3 hours at 56°C rocking at speed
* Every half hour vortex samples

### DNA Extraction

- Create 1.5mL tubes of nuclease free water and 10mM Tris HCl. You will need 100ul per sample
- Warm 10mM Tris HCl and ultrapure water in thermomixer to 70 degrees C
- Add equal volume DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each 50mL tube: 1000ul
- Vortex the tubes after adding the lysis buffer
- Set up 1 collection tube with 1 yellow spin column in it per sample. Label the column with the sample IDs
- Transfer 700ul of the liquid in the 50mL tube to the corresponding yellow spin column
- Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Label a 5mL tube for each sample
- Pipette out the flow through in the collection tubes into the corresponding 5mL tube and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Transfer another 700ul of sample liquid to the corresponding yellow spin column
- Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Pipette out the flow through in the collection tubes into the corresponding 5mL tube
- For the remaining volume, put the yellow column back into the same collection tube and repeat the previous 3 steps
- When all the lysed liquid has gone through the column, transfer the yellow column to a new collection tube and discard the used one
- Get a waste beaker from above the sink, it has a pink label that says "liquid waste"
- Add 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to each yellow column
- Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Add 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each yellow column
- Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Add 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each yellow column
- Centrifuge columns for **2 minutes** seconds at 16,000rcf
- Label new 1.5mL tubes for the final DNA elution: use sample ID, "DNA," the date, and your initials
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Centrifuge the columns "dry" for 1 minute
- Transfer the yellow columns to their corresponding newly labeled 1.5mL tubes. Leave the caps open on the 1.5mL tubes. Collection tubes can be discarded
- Add 50ul of warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow column by dripping onto the white filter
- Incubate/let tubes rest for 5 minutes at room temp
- Centrifuge tubes for 30 seconds at 16,000 rcf
- Add another 50ul of warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow column by dripping onto the white filter
- Incubate/let tubes rest for 5 minutes at room temp
- Centrifuge tubes for 30 seconds at 16,000 rcf
- Place tubes on ice bucket - this is the DNA!
- Label enough 8-strip tubes for your samples
- Transfer 10ul of extracted DNA to their corresponding strip tube
- DNA tubes can be frozen at -20
- Strip tubes can be kept on ice if QC-ing the same day, if not they also go in the -20

### RNA Extraction

- Add equal volume 100% ethanol to each one of your 5mL tubes with the flow through from the DNA columns: 2mL or 2000ul
- Vortex the tubes after adding the ethanol
- Set up 1 collection tube with 1 green spin column in it per sample. Label the column with the sample IDs
- Transfer 700ul of the liquid in the 5mL tube to the corresponding green spin column
- Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Transfer another 700ul of sample liquid to the corresponding green spin column
- Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Continue in the same way for the remaining volume in the 5mL tubes
- Once all the liquid has gone through the column, transfer the green column to a new collection tube and discard the used one
- Add 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each green column
- Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Create the DNase mix (DNase I is stored in the -20 freezer in the Putnam Zymo kit enzymes box):
  - 75ul DNA digestion buffer * number of samples =
  - 5ul DNase I * number of samples =
- Flick DNase mix to mix and spin down (do not vortex, DNase is a sensitive enzyme)
- Add 80ul of DNase mix to each green spin column
- Incubate (let sit) columns for 15 minutes
- Add 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to each green column
- Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Add 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each green column
- Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Add 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each green column

- Pour out the flow through into the waste beaker and put the column back into the same collection tube
- Centrifuge the columns "dry" for 1 minute
- Transfer the green columns to their corresponding newly labeled 1.5mL tubes. Leave the caps open on the 1.5mL tubes. Collection tubes can be discarded

- Label enough 8-strip tubes for your samples
- Transfer 7ul of extracted RNA to their corresponding strip tube
- RNA tubes can be frozen at -80
- Strip tubes can be kept on ice if QC-ing the same day, if not they also go in the -80
