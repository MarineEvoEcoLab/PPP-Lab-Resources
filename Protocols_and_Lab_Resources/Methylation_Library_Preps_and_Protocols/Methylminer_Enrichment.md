## Sonication to ~500bp Peak

1. Follow the [General QSonica Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/General_Equptment_Protocols/Sonicator/QSonica-General-Protocol.md) for set up of the sonicator
2. Thaw DNA samples on ice, vortex and spin down
3. Prepare all samples in QSonica tubes to be 1ug of DNA in 80 total ul: make up any remaining volume with 10mM Tris HCl
4. Sonicatate for 1min 30 sec, 15 second on 15 seconds off, with 25% amplitude (increasing the time to 1min 45 seconds has also worked, you may want to check the size with the tapestation to confirm)
5. Keep sonicated samples on ice until the are ready to be used

## Preparing Beads

1. Prepare enough 1X bind/wash buffer needed. It comes as a 5X concentrate. 850ul are needed per sample for the first day (includes excess)
2. Pipette up and down the Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin to resuspend them
2. Label a 1.5mL tube per sample (Bead Tubes or BT)
3. Add 10µl of Dynabeads to each Bead Tube (the amount recommended for less than or equal to 1µg of DNA input)
3. Bring the volume up to a total of 100µl with 90µl of 1X bind/wash buffer in each BT
4. Pipette to mix
5. Place BTs on long magnet rack and remove and discard supernatant when clear
6. Remove BTs from rack and resuspend beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer
7. Place BTs on long magnet rack and remove and discard supernatant when clear
8. Remove BTs from rack and resuspend beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer

## Coupling MBD-Biotin Protein to the Beads

1. Thaw MBD-Biotin protein from -80 on ice
2. Label a new 1.5mL tube per sample (Protein Tubes or PT)
3. Add 7µl of MBD-Biotin protein to each PT (amount recommended for 1µg of DNA input)
4. Add 93µl of 1X bind/wash buffer to each PT to increase volume up to a total of 100µl
5. Transfer diluted protein from the PTs to the BTs for a total volume of 200µl now in each BT

6. Repeat: Spin down BTs **briefly**
7. Place Bts on magnet rack for 1 minute
8. Remove supernatant when clear
9. Resuspend beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipette to mix
10. Mix BTs on rotisserie mixer for 5 minutes at room temp
11. Repeat again: Spin down BTs **briefly**
12. Place tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
13. Remove supernatant when clear
14. Resuspend beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipette to mix
15. Mix BTs on rotisserie mixer for 5 minutes at room temp
16. Finally: Spin down BTs **briefly**
17. Place BTs on magnet rack for 1 minute
18. Remove supernatant when clear
19. Resuspend beads in 100µl 1X bind/wash buffer and pipette to mix

## Capture Reaction

1. Make 1 new 1.5mL tube per sample (Sample Tubes or STs)
2. Add 20µl of **5X** bind/wash buffer to each ST
3. To each appropriate ST, add the 80µl of the sheared DNA samples (above)
4. Transfer all of the liquid in the STs to their respective BTs for a total of 200µl in each tube and pipette to mix
5. Mix BTs on rotisserie mixer overnight at 4 degrees C in the cold room, this during this the highly methylated DNA is binding with the MBD-coupled beads

## Next Day: Removing Non-Captured DNA

1. Calculate and dilute how much 1X bind/wash buffer you need to make: 12,500ul per sample (include excess)
2. Take BTs out of the cold room rotisserie and spin down **briefly**
3. Place BTs on magnet rack for 1 minute
4. Remove clear supernatant and **SAVE** in tubes labeled non-captured DNA (NCTs) and sample number
5. Resuspend beads in 200µl of 1X bind/wash buffer and place on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
6. Spin down tubes **briefly**
7. Place BTs on magnet rack for 1 minute
8. Remove clear supernatant and **SAVE** in tubes labeled Wash (WTs) and the sample number
9. Repeat: Add 200µl 1X bind/wash buffer to BTs and place on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
10. Spin down tubes **briefly**
11. Place BTs on magnet rack for 1 minute
12. Remove clear supernatant and **SAVE** in the same tubes labeled Wash and the sample number for a total of 400µl in each "Wash" tube

## Single Fraction Elution

2. Incubate BTs on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
3. Spin down BTs **breifly** and place on magnet rack for 1 minute
4. Remove supernatant when clear and **SAVE** in a new 1.5mL tube labeled Captured DNA and the sample number
5. Repeate: Add 200µl High Salt Elution Buffer to resuspend beads in each tube
6. Incubate BTs on rotisserie mixer for 3 minutes
7. Spin down BTss **briefly** and place on magnet rack for 1 minute
8. Remove clear supernatant and **SAVE** in each sample tube for captured DNA (CTs), for a total of 400µl in each tube

## Ethanol Precipitation

1. Decided if you want to precipitate all of the DNA (in washes, not captured, and captured) or just the desired captured DNA (in the CTs)
2. Add to each tube being precipitated:
  - 1ul glycogen
  - 1/10th volume 3M Sodium Acetate p.H 5.2 (40ul for CTs)
  - 2 times volume 100% ethanol (800ul for CTs)
3. Vortex to mix and spin down
4. Place tubes in the -80 freezer for 3.5 hours
5. Set centrifuge to 1 degrees C  with about 15 min time left and let it run to get down to temp
6. Make fresh 70% ethanol: 500ul per sample
7. Put 70% EtOH in -20 to chill down
7. Take CTs out of -80 and centrifuge for **15 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
8. Take CTs out of centrifuge **one at a time** to keep cold, look at tubes to see if there was a pellet (sometimes you can't see a pellet here, but act like there is one)
9. Remove the supernatant and discard **very carefully**
10. Add 500µl of **cold** 70% EtOH to each CT carefully
11. Centrifuge CTs for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
12. **Very carefully** remove supernatant from pellet
13. Centrifuge CTs for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C at 14,000 rcf
14. Remove any remaining supernatant as best as possible with the smallest pipette tip and making sure to not to remove the pellet
15. Air dry the pellet for 3 minutes on the bench
16. Resuspend pellets in 25µl of ultra pure water. Vortex for 10 seconds and spin down. Keep on ice for QC or freeze at -20 for storage

## QC

- Use the [Qubit Assay Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Invitrogen-Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md) and use a High Sensitivity Assay
- Amount of DNA should be very low, could be even less than a ng/ul (remember this is just the highly methylated DNA)


#### Now the captured DNA can be library prepped with the [Pico-MethylSeq](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/Methylation_Library_Preps_and_Protocols/WGBS_Pico_Methyl_Seq_Lib_Prep_protocol.md) method for WGBS
