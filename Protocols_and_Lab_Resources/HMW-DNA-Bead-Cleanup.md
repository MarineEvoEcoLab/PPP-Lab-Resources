# Bead Cleanup for Nanopore Sequencing Or For High Molecular Weight DNA

#### Place beads at RT 30 minutes before use to allow them to equilibrate!
#### Make fresh 80% EtOH

_Notes: never vortex HMW DNA, and if it is a must to pipette mix use wide bore pipette tips_

## Protocol
1.	Add 1.0X beads to DNA. (If 80 µL DNA, add 80 µL beads)
2.	Mix GENTLY by flicking tubes and a very brief spin down in a table top minifuge to bring to the bottom
3.	Leave at room temp 20 minutes on a shaker at 300rpm
4.	Place on magnet plate for 5-10 minutes
5.	Remove clear supernatant without disrupting beads. This can be retained in a new tube if there are concerns about sample loss.
6.	Add 200 µL of 80% EtOH, pipetting against the front wall of the tube, and wait 30 seconds (tube still on magnetic rack)
7.	Remove supernatant
8.	Add 200 µL of 80% EtOH again, wait 30 seconds
9.	Remove supernatant
10.	Spin the tube quickly in a table top minifuge
11.	Place tube on magnetic rack, pipet off any residual ethanol with a p10 and fine tip
12.	Allow tube to dry open on magnetic rack for 1 minute.
13.	Remove tube from rack. Add 50 µL nuclease free H20 (or appropriate volume for intended application)
14.	Gently flick or tap tube until pellet comes off the side, and continue flicking until no bits of pellet are visible. Do not pipet up and down
15.	Leave tube for 30 minutes in thermomixer at 37˚C and undisturbed to elute long fragments. Then leave tube on the shaker at RT for preferably overnight, shaking 300rpm, to elute DNA off beads. Longer times are necessary for longer fragments.
16.	After incubation, place sample tube (with beads) in fridge.  For any subsequent QC analysis or library prep, make sure to pipette off sample with tube in the magnet. Keeping the DNA in the same tube prevents loss of DNA in unnecessary transfers.
