# [Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Prep Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-ribofree-total-rna-library-kit) Protocol

#### Note that the starting volume for RNA is **8ul**. This protocol has been successful with 195ng and 300ng total RNA input. Make sure to standardize the RNA starting amount for all samples in your project

**This protocol has only been done with test kits and may have different volumes for some reagents in a full sized kit**
