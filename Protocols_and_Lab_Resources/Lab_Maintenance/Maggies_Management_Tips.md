# Maggie's Lab Management Tips

### 1. What to do if there is a new student coming in (all levels)

- Show them the [Lab Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kSsQKb1q98p9D-DaWnS4tpYaZkxWGAyFGMmqO1fqxVg/edit#gid=0) before they start working so they can be somewhat familiarized with the place
- Make sure they have done **all** [safety trainings](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/tree/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training) before coming into the lab
- Have the first thing you do with them be a tour/safety walk through. First go through the lab set up.
  - Come through the 180 door, go over DI system and how freezers and fridges are split up by shelf for PIs
  - Go into molec lab and give overviews of each bench, what they're for, if they're shared or not etc. Make sure to specify that other PI's benches and storage are not to be touched. Also go over potential contamination risks of the post-PCR benches and RNA bench and to not touch them
  - Go into the hood room and explain the different cabinets for chemicals, hazardous chemical and where they are, and -80s and specifics about them
  - Go to the organismal space and show the different benches and storage areas
  - Show them the desk spaces and say they're welcome to use them anytime
  - Start the safety checklist and walk through absolutely everything on the list. Show the person each SSA (4), first aid, SDS, etc
- If doing molecular labwork, go through the [pipette exercise](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Exercises_And_Instructions/Pipetting-Exercises.md) with them. Even though it is tedious, it is best to watch them do this and correct every mistake
- When training with protocols, my strategy was to it at least twice **with them**. The first time I would do half the samples and they would do half the samples, working together. The second time I would just watch them go through the whole process and answer questions/catch mistakes
- If they are going to be doing a process with hazardous chemicals, really hammer the importance of safety, PPE, and properly disposing of waste
- Require the student to keep a detailed lab notebook, writing things down as you do them can really be helpful for learning a process

### 2. Write everything down

- Keep a physical lab notebook!! Write every time you mess up, or little notes, everything in here! If you keep online lab notebooks this kind of stuff may not show up on there. I go back to old entries in my notebooks all the time and it's really nice to have my actual "notes" in there

### 3. Links I use all the time

- [Solution Dilution Calculator](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/support/calculators-and-apps/solution-dilution-calculator)
- [ng/ul to nM DNA conversion equation](https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/11/converting-ngl-to-nm-when-calculating-dsdna-library-concentration-.html)
- [Primer annealing temp optimization/PCR success info sheet](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cloning/cloning-learning-center/invitrogen-school-of-molecular-biology/pcr-education/pcr-reagents-enzymes/pcr-cycling-considerations.html)
