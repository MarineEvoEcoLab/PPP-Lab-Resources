# Scraping ice from -80

- Do 1 -80 a week, rotating which freezer gets it which week
- Pick a time of the day/week when the freezer has **not** been recently opened (at least 5 hours)
- Use the green ice scraper to gently scrape built up ice from the seal around the door on the interior of the freezer as well as on the door
- Tap the larger ice pieces to get them to break up if scraping doesn&#39;t work
- Do not be harsh, especially on the door. Pounding/strong movements can damage the door seal or the freezer
- Let the ice fall to the floor and try to move quickly so that the freezer isn&#39;t open for more than 5 min
- Try to keep the inner doors on the freezer closed
- If needed, scrape ice off the outside of the inner freezer doors
- When done, use the squeegee and dustpan to &quot;sweep&quot; up the ice and water and pour it in the sink. Do not leave giant puddles because they are a slip hazard

# Scraping ice from -20 - when needed: frequently in the summer or when it is humid

- Do this only 1 shelf at a time
- Remove all boxes and things from one shelf, shake off any excess ice/snow, and place in an empty freezer space
- Use an ice scraper and squeegee for scraping the ice off the shelf
- Use the blue bin lid (large, by the DI sink) to hold all the ice you scrape off. Scrape into the blue lid to catch all the ice
- Try not to get ice on the level below, slide the blue lid in under the shelf you&#39;re working on so it catches some of that ice
- Pour the ice into the sink from the lid
- Do the same process for scraping ice of the underside of the shelf above
- Be careful not to hit the shelves too hard: they contain the coolant material and should not be broken open
- Put the boxes/items back on the shelf in the same orientation to the best of your abilities
