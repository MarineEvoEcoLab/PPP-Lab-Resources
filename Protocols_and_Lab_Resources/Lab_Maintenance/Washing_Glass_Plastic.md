# Washing Lab Glassware or Plasticware

### Any Plastic or Glassware that may be used for molecular work, and is going back on a shelf or cabinet MUST be cleaned with detergent and Type II DI water and dried in the proper section

**Important things**
- You are responsible for the plastic or glassware piece from the moment you take it off the shelf to the moment you put it back. These are shared resources
- You will use, wash, dry, and return the item back to it's original place
- Do not take a drying piece of glassware or plasticware off the drying rack to use: get a new one from the shelf. This way it is more guaranteed that each item gets washed properly before being put back and used by potentially someone else
- There are 2 sections to drying racks. The top section is for glass or plastic items that have been cleaned with detergent and rinsed with DI. The bottom section is for items just rinsed with tap water (rare)

**Steps**

1. Wear gloves and eye protection while washing. When scrubbing, detergent can get in your eye so please wear eye glasses
2. If your item has a lot of residue/tissue/skeleton/etc stuck in it, first give it a rinse in tap water
3. Squirt for ~2 seconds 10% alkaline glassware detergent (or 10% acid detergent) into your either plastic or glassware item (at each sink)
4. Use an appropriate sized scrubber (at each sink) to scrub the inside and outside of the item. Adjust how much you scrub depending on how dirty the item is. _Note, these detergents don't foam up like home dish soap. However, when you are scrubbing the outside, you'll notice the glass gets slippery so be careful to avoid dropping and breaking items_
5. Rinse the item in tap water 5 times
6. Rinse the item in type II DI water 3 times
7. It can be helpful to use a bin to transfer items to and from different sinks if you have multiple things to clean
8. Place the DI rinsed items on the **top** section of the drying racks
9. Come back the next day or two to put the dried item back on its' original shelf/cabinet

**Other notes**

- **Most** glassware and plasticware can be cleaned with the alkaline glassware detergent. If your item had **bleach**, you should use the 10% acid glassware detergent. If you are unsure on how to clean, look up on the internet to see if you can find anything. It can also be helpful to consider the type of chemical you had in the item. For example, bleach is basic, so you should clean it with the acid detergent to neutralize.
- **Remaking diluted detergents when out**
  - 1 gallon bottles Lab Klenz Acid and Alkaline detergents are under the sinks in the desk and hood rooms
  - Measure 50mL in a beaker and pour into the appropriate squirt bottle
  - Fill the bottle with tap water up to the top (500mL) to make a 10% solution
  - Clean the beaker with 5 rinses in tap water and 3 rinses in DI water
