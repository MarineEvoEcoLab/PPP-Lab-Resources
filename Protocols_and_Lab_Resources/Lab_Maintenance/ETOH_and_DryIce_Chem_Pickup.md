# Picking up Ethanol from Chem

- Wait until you receive/are forwarded an email from the chemistry department and your PI/Colleen Travis saying the PO (purchase order) has been filled, and you get a response from the Chem stockroom saying the order is ready to be picked up
- Go to the Chemistry stockroom (bottom floor, all the way at the end of the hall)
- You will sign at least 2 copies of the PO, and a booklet
- Make sure you take a signed PO with you back so you can scan it and send it to Colleen Travis, have them print you out an extra PO if they don&#39;t have one for you to take back
- Alternatively, print out your own copy of the PO to bring and sign (only possible if you get forwarded the pdf in an email)
- Label the ethanol with the PI name and the date received and store in the flammable cabinet

# Picking Up Dry Ice from Chemistry **THIS WILL CHANGE SOON BECAUSE THEY WILL START CHARGING $ AND YOU WILL NEED A PO, UPDATE THIS**

- It&#39;s best to email the day before, but sometimes it works to email the day of
- email stockroom@chm.uri.edu and the stockroom manager tmarkmaitree@uri.edu, say you work in CBLS and that you would like to fill a small cooler with dry ice
- Give a date and time you&#39;d like to stop by
- Usually they will email back saying if they have some in (they sometimes do not have it the day you need it/the same day. Chem, CBLS, and Pharmacy all use their dry ice so they can run out)
- Take a cooler (small Aglient box is best) to Chem stockroom (9am to 4pm) and ask the people working there for dry ice (say you&#39;re from CBLS)
