# Picking up Ethanol from Chem

- You'll need and IVPO first before picking up. Contact your PI about ordering a "1 gallon 200 proof ethanol bottle"
- Wait until you receive/are forwarded an email from the chemistry department and your PI/Colleen Travis saying the PO (purchase order) has been filled, and you get a response from the Chem stockroom saying the order is ready to be picked up
- Go to the Chemistry stockroom (bottom floor, all the way at the end of the hall)
- You will sign at least 2 copies of the PO, and a booklet
- Make sure you take a signed PO with you back so you can scan it and send it to Colleen Travis, have them print you out an extra PO if they don&#39;t have one for you to take back
- Alternatively, print out your own copy of the PO to bring and sign (only possible if you get forwarded the pdf in an email)
- Label the ethanol with the PI name and the date received and store in the flammable cabinet

# Picking Up Dry Ice from Chemistry

- **You will need to get and IVPO with your PI first before getting dry ice from Chemistry, it might be best to set up a blanket PO that they can charge from**
- Dry ice is $1 a pound
- A regular sized Agilent cooler box fits 9lbs of dry ice
- Email	stockroom@chm.uri.edu and tmarkmaitree@uri.edu with the IVPO information and how much dry ice you'll need
- Wait for confirmation from them (in case they're out) before heading over to the stockroom (bottom floor of chem, all the way at the end of the hall) with your cooler
