# Sending Packages

## UPS

- Login link for campus shipping : [https://www.campusship.ups.com/login/5412rv?reasonCode=-2](https://www.campusship.ups.com/login/5412rv?reasonCode=-2)
- Login for UPS for Puritz or Prada:
  - **Username and password are in lab 190 with the shipping scale**
- Login for UPS for Putnam:
  - **Username and password are in lab 190 with the shipping scale**
- Record the length, width, and height of the package. After filling it, record the weight (scale and tape measures are on the brown shelves with the lab notebooks)
- You can save the ship to address if you&#39;ll be using it again in the future
- For Puritz and Prada, make sure to edit the return and ship address to say Carlos Prada or Jon Puritz
- For Puritz and Prada, write the PI&#39;s name in the &quot;reference&quot; section so that it gets properly billed to them
- For Putnam, write the project PO number if applicable in the &quot;reference&quot; section

  - 7738: Roli-Epi/E5
  - 8088: Syn Coral
- Sign up for email notifications on shipping (no extra cost)
- **IF YOU ARE SHIPPING DRY ICE**
  - Check the box for dry ice and record the weight of the dry ice in kg
  - A dry ice transportation hazard label has to be fixed to the outside of the box. Label with the ship from address and the ship to address (consignee&#39;s address) and the weight of the dry ice in kg. These are in a pouch on the shelf next to the scale. Sending the package is **illegal** without this label
- **IF YOU ARE SHIPPING A DRY SHIPPER**
  - If it is one of the big ones (tan or blue), check &quot;large package&quot; so they know it&#39;s big
  - Input a declared value of $4000 for a large shipper and $2000 for the small shipper, regardless of whether you have anything in it or not (the cost of the shipper). This is so we can be reimbursed if the shipper gets lost
  - This will cause an extra form to pop up when you make the label. Print two copies of this form, so UPS can sign both and keep one and return one to you. Attach this to the shipper in the loading dock along with the &quot;UPS PICKUP&quot; sign. Write on the paper &quot;UPS please sign, thank you!!&quot; on the forms. Pick up the signed form at the end of the day and holepunch to keep in the binder of insurance recipets on the bookshelf with the lab notebooks.
  - For UPS to pick up something this expensive it has to be &quot;locked&quot;. For the small dry shipper, there is no way to lock it so you have to tape it closed with packing tape. For the large dry shippers, the latches can be zip-tied with the top and bottom together but going through some of the holes in the latches/little holes in the shipper
- Once you&#39;ve made the label, scroll down and click on the &quot;schedule a pickup&quot; link. Usually UPS comes once in the morning and once in the afternoon (around 2pm), however not always in the afternoon so it is best to schedule a pickup every time (no extra cost)
  - All the information for CBLS is already inputted, just indicate how many packages and the shipping type. Add in &#39;loading dock&quot; in the extra information section, but the UPS drivers know where to go
- Bring the package down to the loading dock and place it on the empty shelf next to Nasir&#39;s door. Place the &quot;UPS PICKUP&quot; paper sign on it so the drivers know what is for them. If there are no signs, print one out yourself. If the package is too big to go on the shelf, place on the ground next to the shelf
