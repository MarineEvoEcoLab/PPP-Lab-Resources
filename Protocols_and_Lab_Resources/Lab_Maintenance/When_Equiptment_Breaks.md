# When Equipment Breaks

- If something breaks in the lab, whoever noticed the issue will come to you to help deal with the situation
- There might be an error message and/or instructions on how to troubleshoot the issue (like if it&#39;s a software issue), go through those and see if you can fix the situation
- If it&#39;s a hardware issue/something is clearly broken, first ask the person using it if they noticed anything weird about it before it broke or if they properly followed the protocol for use
- If the equipment is clearly un-usable and something is seriously wrong, it will need repairs (or replacing)
- Send an email or message to all three PIs informing them of the issue, depending on the type of equipment and the problem, say either that we&#39;ll need a new one or that you&#39;ll be contacting technical service about the issue. Usually we want to contact technical service before giving up on a piece of equipment
- Put a sign on the equipment that says &quot;Do Not Use, Broken&quot; and send an email out to the master list of lab users telling everyone that that equipment is offline for the time being
- Contact the technical service email/phone of the company that made the equipment. Also sometimes they have forms you can fill out online. Have the serial number ready because they will ask for it. Make sure to explain the issue fully to the technicians
- Update the PIs fequently on the situation, what the technician suggests, etc.
- Follow through with the process until the equipment is fixed or new one is purchased. When it&#39;s in working condition again, send an email to everyone saying it&#39;s fixed
