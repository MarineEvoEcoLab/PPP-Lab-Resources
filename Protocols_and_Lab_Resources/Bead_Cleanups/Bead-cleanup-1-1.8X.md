# Standard Bead Cleanup Protocol for 1X or 1.8X

**Notes**

- If you want to retain **all** DNA fragments, do a 1.8X cleanup
- If you want to remove fragments below 100bp, do a 1X cleanup
- X means times the volume you have, ex. if you have a 50ul sample, a 1X cleanup would use 50ul beads and a 1.8X cleanup would use 90ul beads
- KAPA Pure beads are viscus so pipette slowly, you also want to avoid creating bubbles because that can interfere with magnetization. **Pipette slowly**
- Make fresh 80% ethanol for each day, use a 50mL conical and add 40mL of 100% ethanol and 10mL of nuclease free water
- Use a trough for waste (let dry overnight and then you can throw it away)
- Liquid to elute in depends on the application/protocol (it is usually TE buffer, water, or 10mM Tris HCl)
- Elution volume also depends on the application/protocol. Volumes below 10ul are very hard to pipette/resuspend the beads properly. Note if you are trying to concentrate your DNA, the elution volume should be less than the starting DNA volume

### Procedure

- Take KAPA Pure beads out of the 4 degree fridge 30 minutes before use
- Swirl them gently to mix the beads that have settled
- For warming, keep in a drawer because they are slightly light sensitive
- Swirl again right before use
- If using the multichannel, calculate the total volume of beads needed + 5% error and add to a trough
- Add desired volume to each sample tube (1X, 1.8X) by slowly pipetting and mixing with the pipette by pipetting up and down **at least 10 times**
- Liquids in tubes should now look homogeneously brown
- Place tubes/plate on the orbital shaker (by the Qubit) for 15 minutes at 200rpm speed
- Bring magnet to shaker and place tubes/plate on magnet, let it shake at 200rpm for 2-5 minutes, or until you can see the liquid has turned clear and all the beads are on the magnet. Shaking helps this happen faster
- Keep the tubes/plates on the magnet and bring to the lab bench
- Remove most of the lear liquid from each tube/well and expel into the waste trough. Set your pipette to ~5ul below the volume in the tube. Follow the wall of the tube down the opposite side from the beads and slowly aspirate off the liquid. If you suck up beads, pipette it back into the tube/well and wait 1-2 minutes for the liquid to become clear again and try the removal again
- Add 200ul fresh 80% ethanol to each tube/well, add to the side of the tube without the beads
- Remove 200ul from each tube/well without disturbing the beads and expel in the waste trough
- Add 200ul fresh 80% ethanol to each tube/well, add to the side of the tube without the beads
- Remove 200ul from each tube/well without disturbing the beads and expel in the waste trough
- Use a p20 set to 20ul to remove any excess ethanol wash in each tube/well. Pipette from the bottom of the tube/well
- Wait 1-5 minutes for any residual ethanol to evaporate, don't wait too long because the beads should not dry
- Take tubes/plate off the magnet
- Resuspend the beads in the desired volume of elutate: pipette directly onto the bead clump slowly. The beads should slide off the clump and resuspend into the liquid. Pipette several times until all the beads are off the side of the tube/plate and the liquid is homogeneously brown. Again you want to avoid bubbles forming
- Place tubes/plate on the shaker for 5 minutes at 200rpm
- Label new tubes/plate for the cleaned DNA
- Bring magnet to shaker and place tubes/plate on magnet, let it shake at 200rpm for 2 minutes, or until you can see the liquid has turned clear and all the beads are on the magnet. This should be faster this time
- Remove the clear liquid from each tube/plate and put into new tubes/plates
- These tubes/plate should be stored on ice buckets if using that day, stored in the fridge if using the next day, or frozen for longer storage
