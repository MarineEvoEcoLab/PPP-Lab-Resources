# Pipetting Exercises


### Proficient pipetting is probably the most crucial part of this lab, for three reasons:

- Accurate pipetting is crucial to the success of molecular projects. Mistakes during pipetting may cause your experiments (e.g. PCR) to fail or to be irreproducible, and thus cause long delays and considerable expense
- Pipettes are delicate pieces of equipment with high accuracy, which can easily be knocked off their calibration. Furthermore, they are expensive – each set of pipettes represent about $ 1,500.
- Pipettes are the main source of contamination in PCRs, and thus can cause a lot of problems.

### Never
*	Never rotate volume adjustor beyond the upper or lower limit
    *	Changes calibration
*	Never use without a tip.
    *	Liquid will get into piston – damage and contamination.
*	Never lay down or turn upside down a pipette with filled tip.
    *	Liquid could run back into the piston, and damage/contaminate it.
    *	Use pipette holders provided
*	Never let plunger snap back after withdrawing or ejecting fluid
    *	Damages piston
    
### Use
* Use the correct pipette. Never adjust the volume beyond the maximum or minimum setting, but also do not use pipettes that are too large. Accuracy and precision drop rapidly towards the lower limit of settings.
* Adjust volume by first unlocking the plunger and then twisting the plunger. Be sure to locate the decimal point correctly when reading the volume setting 
* Firmly seat the proper-sized tip on end of the pipette. If the fit is lose, you will draw up less volume than intended and the liquid will drip from the tip during use. But also do not bang the pipette into the tip. It should fit snugly with a reasonable amount of pressure
* The pipettes have a two-stop position plunger. Depressing to the first stop measures the desired volume. Depressing to the second stop introduces an additional volume of air to blow out any remaining fluid from the tip.
* To withdraw fluid from tube.
    - Hold the pipette almost vertically (< 20o from vertical)
    - Depress plunger to first stop and hold. Dip tip 2-4 mm into the fluid.  Do not push down to the bottom of the vial, otherwise the tip is blocked and you draw less liquid than intended.
    - Gently release thumb. If you release quickly, you will create aerosols (small droplets), which will contaminate the pipette.
    - Wait for a second or so, to confirm that all the liquid has been taken up (especially important for high viscosity liquids).
    - Take the tip out of the liquid.
    - Check that there is no air space at the very end of the tip.
    - Learn the approximate levels that particular volumes fill the tip – this will allow you to check your pipetting visually.
* To expel sample into tube
    - Touch tip to wall of tube or to the liquid at the bottom of the tube if there is already some in there
    - Slowly depress plunger to first, and then to the second stop to expel fluid. **Don't expect the force of the pipette ejection to spray the liquid out of the tip. This doesn't work with smaller volumes and you often don't get the liquid out of the tip if you are quick about it. Most liquids have high surface tension and like to be stuck to itself, so if you don't add it to another liquid it's actually harder for it to leave the tip.**
    - Wait until the tip is fully out of the tube until you release the plunger
* Eject the tip into trash, by pressing the tip ejector button.

Prevention of cross contamination

-	Use a fresh tip each time
-	Do not touch the tube with the pipette, only with the tip
-	If you suspect pipette-body contamination, wipe with ethanol on the outside.
-	Draw up liquid slowly to prevent the formation of aerosols, bubbles also mess up your volume
-	If you tap the tip to anything, get a new one to avoid contamination

### Our Tips

- We have Rainin blue and white pipettes
- There are 4 sizes:
   - p2 
   - p20 
   - p200
   - p1000
- They are "named" for their maximum volume
- p2
   - Uses tips from the red box, it has a red spot on the plunger
   - Volumes are between 0.1 and 2ul
   - On the pipette, the black numbers are whole numbers (either 1, 2, or 0)
   - The red numbers are decimals, this pipette goes to 2 decimal places
   - For example, if the three numbers show 187, that is 1.87ul
- p20
   - Uses tips from the red box, it has a red spot on the plunger
   - Volumes between 2 and 20ul
   - On the pipette the black numbers are whole numbers (the top one is either 0, 1 or 2, the middle one is 0-9)
   - The red number is the decimal place
   - For example, if the three number show 030, that is 3ul. If it shows 124, that is 12.4ul
- p200
   - Uses tips from the green box, it has a green spot on the plunger
   - Volumes between 20 and 200ul
   - On the pipette all the numbers are black, they are all whole numbers, this pipette shows you exactly what it is set at
   - For example, if the three numbers show 188, then that is 188ul
- p1000
   - Uses tips from the blue box, it has a blue spot on the plunger
   - Volumes between 200 and 1000ul
   - On the pipette, the top red number can only ever be set to 1 with all the others set to 0. For anything other than 1000ul, this is set to 0. It can never go above 1000ul and it is red to remind you of that
   - The black numbers are the hundreds and tens, this pipette does not go exactly to the 1s, only with the tick marks. 
   - For example, if the three numbers say 100, that means 1000ul. If it says 089, that is 890ul
 

### Pipetting exercise
Be careful to use the correct pipette. Use distilled water. You don’t have to change tips for these exercises. As you do these exercises, look at the pipette tip when it is holding a volume so you can learn to check your pipetting visually.

The pipettes have an accuracy and precision of about 1% - any more than that is human pipetting error! If you got it very wrong, try again.
