### DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol for Khadija

#### Arcopora chunks stored in 2mL of DNA/RNA Shield

#### Set up

1. Thaw samples on an ice bucket
2. Clean a forceps with (in order):
  - 10% bleach
  - Type II DI water
  - 70% ethanol
3. Take Proteinase K and DNase I out of the freezer (in Putnam Zymo kit enzymes box) and put on the ice bucket  
  **Note:** Write on tubes with sharpie
4. For sample homogenization set up 2 1.5mL tubes per sample. Label each with the sample ID, and on 1 tube write "H" for homogenate and the other tube write "L" for lysis
5. For DNA extraction set up 1 yellow spin column in a collection tube for each sample. Set up 1 extra collection tube per sample to use during the extraction
6. For DNA elution, set up 1 1.5mL tube per sample. Write the sample ID and "DNA" on the cap. On the side of the tube, write the sample ID, "DNA", the date, and your initials
7. For saving the flowthrough from the DNA extraction, set up 1 1.5mL tube per sample labeled with the sample ID and "R" for RNA
8. For RNA Extraction set up 1 green/blue spin column in a collection tube for each sample. Set up 1 extra collection tube per sample to use during the extraction
9. For RNA elution, set up 1 1.5mL tube per sample. Write the sample ID and "RNA" on the cap. On the side of the tube, write the sample ID, "RNA", the date, and your initials
10. Pipette 1mL of 10mM Tris HCl into a 1.5mL tube labeled "Tris", pipette 1mL of ultrapure water into a 1.5mL tube labeled "H20". Put both tubes in the Thermomixer at 70 degrees C. These are the warmed liquids the DNA and RNA are eluted in

#### Homogenization

10. Pipette 700ul liquid from the first sample tube into it's respective "H" homogenate tubes
11. Take a cleaned forceps and break up the coral chunk in the sample tube. Try to break in half if possible. Use the forceps to take half the chunk from the sample tube and put it in the 700ul now in the "H" tube.   
  **Note:** This is to save part of your tissue in case you need to re-extract, and to make room in the tube for the homogenization beads
12. When you're done with the forceps for 1 sample, clean again with 10% bleach, DI water, then 70% ethanol
13. Repeat steps 10-12 for each sample  
  **Note:** Save sample tubes by putting back into the freezer
14. Open bead tube and pour 1/2 the amount of beads into 1 "H" tube, pour the other half into the next "H" tube. Repeat for the rest of your "H" tubes, giving each 1/2 volume of the beads in each bead tube
15. Vortex all "H" tubes at max speed for 2 minutes  
  **Note:** this breaks the tissue off the skeleton and opens the cells. The liquid also gets very bubbly here
16. To remove bubbles, centrifuge "H" tubes for 2 minutes in the benchtop centrifuge (blue lid)
17. Pipette 300ul liquid from the "H" tubes into their respective "L" lysis tubes  
  **Note:** Save "H" tube by putting into the freezer with the sample tubes
18. Add 30ul ProK digestion buffer to each "L" tube
19. Add 15ul Proteinase K to each "L" tube _note, pro K is viscous so pipette slowly_
20. Vortex "L" tubes for ~10 seconds
21. Spin down "L" tubes quickly in the blue benchtop centrifuge

#### DNA Extraction

22. Add 345ul DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each "L" tube  
  **Note:** this is equal volume (1:1 ratio) of what should be in each "L" tube
23. Vortex and spin down "L" tubes
24. Transfer 700ul of the liquid in the "L" tube to the corresponding yellow spin column  
  **Note:** this should be about all the volume in the "L" tube
25. Centrifuge tubes at 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
26. Pipette out the flow through (700ul) from the collection tubes into the corresponding 1.5mL tube labeled "R" for the flow through
27. Transfer the yellow column to a new collection tube and discard the used one
28. Get a waste beaker from above the sink, it has a pink label that says "liquid waste"
29. Add 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to each yellow column
30. Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
31. Pipette the flow through into the waste beaker (400ul) and put the column back into the same collection tube
32. Add 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to each yellow column
33. Centrifuge columns for 30 seconds at 16,000rcf
34. Pipette the flow through into the waste beaker (700ul) and put the column back into the same collection tube

36. Centrifuge columns for **2 minutes** at 16,000rcf
37. Pipette the flow through into the waste beaker (400ul) and put the column back into the same collection tube
38. Centrifuge the columns "dry" for 1 minute
39. Transfer the yellow columns to their corresponding 1.5mL tubes for DNA elution. Leave the caps open on the 1.5mL tubes. Collection tubes can be discarded
40. Add 50ul of warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow column by dripping onto the white filter
41. Let tubes rest for 5 minutes at room temp
42. Centrifuge tubes for 30 seconds at 16,000 rcf
