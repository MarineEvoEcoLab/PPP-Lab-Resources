# Making, Loading, and Imaging a 100-Well Gel

**Tips for Making the Gel**

- Following the gel protocol, making a 1% gel is 1.5g agarose and 150mL _new_ 1X TAE buffer
- For microwaving, this gel takes at least 2 minutes
- In our 150mL flasks, 150mL is a little large of a volume, but it still works for this gel, you just want to be careful
- Before the gel starts to boil, doing the usual stop every 20 seconds to mix is good
- _Once it starts boiling, immediately stop and mix by swirling. It can boil over easily, especially the first time it starts boiling_
- Put it back in and start again. Once it starts rigorously boiling, stop again and mix. Repeat this close watching and stopping until there are no "flakes" in the gel
- Add 1ul of gel green and swirl to mix, let rest on the countertop for _at least_ 5 minutes, this gel is hot and there is a lot of it
- Set up the casting tray on the clear large tray, use the level and wheels to adjust the balance

**Video for Loading the Gel**  
- Things you will need:
  - p20 12 channel multichannel (on post-PCR bench)
  - Tip box that is entirely full, plus a refill
  - A 96 rack that has a piece of parafilm completely stretched over it
  - 12 strip tubes with loading dye in each tube

**Tips for Imaging the Gel**
- The whole gel doesn't fit into one phone image, it is easiest to image the right and the left sides separately
- Use the large orange plate as the filter for imaging, place it over the gel and it also acts as a barrier for the black imaging housing to sit on top of. You may have to wipe it a few times with a paper towel because it gets condensation
