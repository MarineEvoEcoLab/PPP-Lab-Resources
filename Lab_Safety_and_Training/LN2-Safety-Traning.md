# Liquid Nitrogen Safety, Training, and Facts

Before using the liquid nitrogen (LN2) in our labs, you must read through the resources provided, answer the questionnaire, and send Maggie (meschedl@uri.edu) completed answers to the questions.

There are also pictures of all the containers that safely hold LN2 for various purposes, and specific info about LN2 in our lab. At the bottom there are instructions for charging a dry shipper.

### Containers in our lab the can hold LN2

Thermoflask (Puritz Lab). Can be used to transport LN2 briefly from other floors in CBLS and around the lab. Can be used for flash freezing.

White Nalgene container. Used mostly for pouring off into. The lid isn't completely secure, you can use it to move LN2 around the room. But it's mostly too large to pour. Can be used for flash freezing.

Small dry shipper (Putnam Lab). Used for shipping when charged and LN2 is poured off. Holds less ~90 2mL tubes.

Large dry shippers (Putnam Lab). Used for shipping when charged and LN2 is poured off. Empty weight inside case is 60lbs. Gets heavier when charged (70lbs), and is more than that when liquid is still inside.

Large cooler, used **only** for pouring off small amounts of excess LN2. It is not pressurized/made for storage.

### Things to know about our LN2 cylinder/LN2 in our lab
- It has a pressure relief valve, if it is making a soft hiss sound, that is normal and it is releasing some pressure. Potentially LN2 tanks loose ~2% of their contents per day just by releasing pressure. This is usually where the pressure gauge is, with a metal valve next to it, however each new tank we get can be different
- If you think there are any issues with the tank, contact Maggie
- If the pressure relief valve is venting loudly, there could be an issue, or it could just need some help venting. You can open the vent valve for a few seconds and then close it again, and try tapping on the pressure relief valve (gently) with a wrench
- If the pressure relief value is frosted up, you can wipe at it with a wet cloth or pour a little water over it
- If there are problems with the tank, you can call AirGas in Warwick 401-732-2920 or the company number for emergencies 1-866-734-3438
- The hose has a phase separator on the end of it, this causes the hose to make loud "whale" sounds when you start opening the tank valve. This is because you are opening up a super high pressure tank that is immediately turning from liquid to gas. Once the liquid is coming out of the hose (the hose has chilled enough), the sound fades away. If the hose is making a constant whale screech, the tank is most likely empty
- It's hard to know exactly how much LN2 is left in a tank, however you can check the pressure gauge, when we get a new tank it is at 20-22psi. There is usually also a little floater measure in the middle of the tank
- The SDS for LN2 is taped to the wall next to the cylinder
- **You cannot transport liquid nitrogen out of this building**, _you especially cannot take any container that has LN2 in it in your car_. A dry shipper properly charged has no liquid in it, this is for transport. You can only use the small metal thermoflask to move LN2 between rooms/floors of CBLS.  The white tall container can be used to move LN2 between rooms, but it cannot be more than halfway full (does not fully seal). Make sure these containers have their lids closed during transport. These containers are not pressurized, so make sure that they have cooled down before moving, and that the transport is brief. If you're worried about the pressure, stop and open the lid briefly to release pressure. For example, these have been used to get LN2 from the 2nd floor (if we're out), or bring LN2 to lab benches for use in our lab space.

### Questions to Answer

1. When using LN2 you should wear eye protection, cryogenic or heavy duty gloves, and long clothes or lab coat. Where in the lab is this PPE located?
2. What are 3 main hazards to liquid nitrogen?
3. Why is it important to add or pour of LN2 slowly from any container?
4. Why can you not travel/move containers with LN2 between buildings or in cars, etc?
5. If you have any questions about LN2 safety or handling, who should you ask?
6. Name one thing you learned that you didn't know previously/was surprising to you.

### Charging dry shippers
- Start charging ~24 hours before needed, this allows for longer charging, and the amount of LN2 left to pour off is usually less (easier to deal with)
- Take the shipper out of the container
- Place on the ground or on the trolly under the LN2 hose (use the trolly if extra height is needed)
- Put on cryo gloves or latex palm gloves (you should use the cryo gloves for touching the hose, but sometimes the valve is hard to turn, so the latex palm gloves can be helpful to get an initial grip to open it)
- Take out the lid and put the hose inside the shipper
- Slowly turn the liquid valve open (to the right), there should be loud sounds as the pressure is being released and the hose cools down enough to allow liquid to pass through
- Wait until you can see liquid coming out of the phase separator before adjusting how much is coming out of the hose. Don't have it come out fast though, this can cause pressure to build up inside the dry shipper dangerously, and it can cause a release in pressure inside the cylinder too quickly
- Stay with the dry shipper as you fill it
- Fill until the container is mostly full, do not fill above the metal inner canister
- Turn the valve back closed and wait until the hose stops dripping LN2 before removing from inside the shipper
- Put the lid back in the shipper and slide the shipper into the open space right next to the tank
- Put a stickie note on the shipper that says "Do not touch, charging with LN2"
- Let the shipper charge for ~24 hours if possible
- When ready to pour off, **you must have two people**
- Use the white tall container or a large styrofoam cooler as containers to pour off the LN2 into, do not pour onto the floor
- Make sure you're wearing eye protection and proper clothes/lab coat
- Have both people have one hand on the handle and one hand under the shipper to lift and pour off the liquid into the container. Communicate and take breaks if needed. The shipper with liquid is probably ~70lbs or more. Be mindful of how you're feeling, and if you feel weird, stop immediately
- Our lab has pretty tall ceilings and is open to the main lab space, but you can also prop open wide the lab door to add extra ventilation
- Usually there is a trickle of LN2 coming out of the shipper for longer than you'd expect, so wait for that to stop before putting the shipper down and back into the case
- Once it's empty and back in the case, you can fill it with your samples or send it away
- For the container holding the excess LN2, cover with the lid and place in a well-ventilated place with no traffic (besides the tank is ok, or under an unused bench). Put a stickie note on it that says "Do not touch, LN2"
