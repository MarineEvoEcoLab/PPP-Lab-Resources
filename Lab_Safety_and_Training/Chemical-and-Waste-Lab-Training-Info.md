# PPP Lab Hazardous/Dangerous Materials, Waste Training and Laboratory Chemicals Info-Sheet and Learning Module

#### For working in the molecular lab, all students must go through this module. Even if you are not personally working with hazardous chemicals, others around you in the lab may be, and you have a right to know the materials in the space you're working with. Additionally, there is information on general chemicals and laboratory guidelines that you are required to be aware of and follow.

### Lab Safety Resources

#### Video Resources
- [URI Lab Safety Overview Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgKEHqBgBsg)

### PPP Lab Specifics

**PPE and Clothing**

- Wear long pants and close-toed shoes everyday in the lab
- Tie/pull long hair back and out of your face
- Wear gloves, eye-glasses (lab-issued or your own), and a lab-issued face mask every day (see [covid safety sheet for info on PPE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RItpcOFZI0T6aTkfYLSGI_OZHsc7OSH4UqlL_MfDN-M/edit?usp=sharing))
- When working with very hazardous chemicals work in the fume hood
- When working with hazardous chemicals or when working in the fume hood, wear a lab coat
- No food or drink are allowed in the lab, **no water**

**Chemical Storage**
- All non-water and non in-lab mixed (solutions that lab members mix or dilute themselves) liquid chemicals that are non-flammable or acidic are stored in cabinet J3 next to the fume hood. There are 3 shelves, one for each PI
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5193.jpg)
- You can find a list of all liquid chemicals in that cabinet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KyMLr2TK_TF1JAwBU1fq7Ds6WTsBWPS5apQrQoHXdP4/edit?usp=sharing)
- Solid chemicals (other than agarose) are stored in cabinet J1. There are 3 shelves, one for each PI
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5192.jpg)
- You can find a list of all solid chemicals in that cabinet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yDtKuec2nwIWYFENB9Ll93Q8GENJnJBYu026NQuk3zk/edit?usp=sharing)
- All flammable liquids are stored in the flammable cabinet under the hood. Not all liquids are from the PPP labs, some are from the Thornber lab. When using this cabinet, **make sure the doors latch when closed**. If you do not latch the door, it is no longer fire-proof
- You can find a list of all flammable chemicals in that cabinet for our labs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYZ34OU6GBhAvuHS4IEkn64MvySKwOOeeKIhfnNXUkI/edit#gid=0)
- We also have a fire-proof 4 degree fridge, opposite the titrator in the organismal lab. For anything that needs to be kept cold and is also flammable, they are stored there. For example, tissue samples stored in ethanol are kept in this fridge. **We do not have a fire-proof freezer**
- All acid storage is in the acid cabinet also under the hood. There are also some Thornber lab chemicals in there
- You can find a list of all acid chemicals in that cabinet for our labs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JE6HakGNpniX6lm_KX9suQDHxghloytCORpnpKGzzDg/edit#gid=0)
- Zinc-buffered formalin is stored in cabinet J9
- Sodium hydroxide and regular formalin are stored in cabinet J8
- The chemical spill kit and polyform crystals (for formalin spills) are stored in J10
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5194.jpg)

**Working in the Fume Hood**
- When working with hazardous and vaporous chemicals (acids, flammables, and formalins), work in the fume hood and wear a lab coat
- Keep the chemical bottles inside a secondary containment bin in case of spills
- Keep space in the fume hood free by not storing items in there and cleaning up when you are done
- Never lift the sash (door) above the set line when in use (if moving something inside quickly that is ok). If you can, try not to lift it above 14 inches while working because that is the height it gets certified at
- If the alarm goes off, try to figure out why. Is it because the sash is open high? What does the alarm say? Usually it is because the air flow is too low. Air flow when the sash is closed should be at 350. When open at a normal working height it should be around 150. If it drops below 80, that is an unsafe air flow speed and it will alarm. If the hood gives you a low flow alarm at a regular working height, it needs to be looked at by a technician so you need to inform the lab manager or the building manager Nasir.

**Sharps Management**
- When working with razor blades or scalpels, you must dispose of them in the sharps container
- When working with syringes, they must be capped before disposal in the sharps container
- A full sharps container can be taped securely shut and disposed of in the dumpster outside of the loading dock
- All broken glass should be cleaned up with a broom/sweeper (if possible) and disposed of in the glassware disposal box
- A full glassware disposal box must be taped closed and gently disposed of in the dumpster outside of the loading dock

**Liquid/Hazardous Waste Management**
- Before starting a new protocol, determine if any waste you'll generate is going to be hazardous or if it can be disposed of in the trash or sink safely
- Look in the SDS, protocol, manual, and containers for signs of corrosive, flammable, reactive, toxic, harmful to the environment, etc. **The SDS is the Safety Data Sheet**, available by googling the chemical, will tell you all the hazards of that chemical
- **Hazard Classes** Tell you how severe one of the hazards is for the chemical you have, these are usually found in the SDS, often in the transportation section
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/2b49b5b7acc6e477deee91ef7f60cd4c.jpg)
- **HCS Pictograms** are often on the bottle or container and will warn you to types of hazards are present
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-29%20at%201.01.38%20PM.png)
- For specifics on what hazards pertain to the chemical, look in the SDS
- If your solutions have any of these, the waste should be treated as hazardous and disposed of in a SAA (satellite accumulation area)
- Store waste in a waste beaker while doing the protocol and use it to pour into the waste container at the SAA when done. Choose a waste container appropriate to the waste, most of what we use can be stored in any plastic bottle, but be sure to check if you waste needs to be stored in a glass bottle.
- There are extra bottles that can be used for hazardous waste storage around the main SAA and in the drawer below it. You should save large buffer/water/chemical bottles from your procedures so they can be later on used as waste bottles
- Make a hazardous waste label for the waste container, list **all** components of the liquid and approximate percentages of each one. Put your PIs name, room number (CBLS 180 or 190), and check off all types of hazards present. Add notes if applicable (ie if waste is from a kit, put the name of the kit as a reference)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5347.jpg)
- When a waste container is full, to request for it to be picked up by EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) use [this link](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/online-pickup/). Make sure to list out all contents of the containers
- There are 3 satellite accumulation areas in the lab for liquid waste (and one for solid waste)
- The SAA by the fume hood is for most of our molecular lab chemical wastes, such as kit and assay wastes
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5190.jpg)
- The SAA under the Qubit station is for formalin wastes
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5189.jpg)
- The SAA next to the titrator is for titrator and aquarium room wastes
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5186.jpg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5187.jpg)

**Solid Hazardous/Non-Hazardous Gel Waste Management**
- For pipette tips, gloves, tubes, paper towels, and other materials that come in contact with our really hazardous materials (see below), these cannot go in the trash and should be disposed of as solid hazardous wastes
- Make a ziploc bag with a hazardous waste label that says "solid wastes with X chemical residue" on it
- **You must use a ziploc bag that has NO CRACKS OR BREAKS, it must seal completely. Do NOT overfill the bag so you cannot close it.**
- Eject tips into that bag and put other solid wastes into it
- Store the waste bag in the solid waste SAA (black bucket by the fume hood)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5191.jpg)
- Request for pickup the same way as with a liquid waste
- Agarose gels are **non hazardous** but we still have them picked up by EHS for disposal. After you have finished imaging your gel, put it in the black plastic bucket (double bagged) in the cabinet under the gel bench (note that it says non-hazardous gel waste)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_5188.jpg)
- Request for pickup the same way as with a liquid waste, however say "non-hazardous agarose gel waste" in the description. Additionally in the field for the location information, be sure to request for new bags (needs to be double bagged)

**Very Hazardous Chemicals that Require Using the Fume Hood and/or Making Solid Waste Bags**
- **Tri-Reagent or Trizol Reagent** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Methanol** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Acetonitrile** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Chloroform or Chlorofom/Isoamy Alcohol** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Neutral Buffered Formalin or Zinc Buffered Formalin** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Beta-Mercaptoethanol** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **1-Bromo-3-Cholorpropane** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Titrator waste with Mercuric Chloride** (just solid waste bag)
- **Sulfuric Acid** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Phosphoric Acid** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **4% Paraformaldehyde** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Benzalkonium Chloride** (fume hood and waste bag)
- **Phenol** (fume hood and waste bag)

**Diluting or Mixing Chemicals for Lab Use**
- If you are using any of the chemicals (solids or liquids) to make a stock solution (ie a buffer or a reagent from scratch), make sure to determine if the container you plan to use can hold the solution
- Write out the full chemical names of the solution on tape on the container, **do not abbreviate**. For example, TE buffer should be labeled as Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid Buffer. If you need to write on the abbreviation to recognize it, write both
- If the solution contains hazardous chemicals, write out the hazard on the new container (ie flammable, toxic, etc)

### What to do if There is a Spill or Exposure on Yourself of Something Hazardous

**Notify someone else who is physically in the lab with you immediately, preferably the lab manager or lab captain if there, so they can help you and call for help (911) if needed.**

**Spills**
- Determine if you can clean it up safely or if everyone in the lab need to leave the room because of hazardous vapors. If the spill is in the fume hood, evacuation is not necessary. If the spill is only a few drops, evacuation is likely not necessary. If it is a large spill outside the fume hood of something with hazardous vapors (any chemical from list above), evacuate to be safe and call 911 and/or EHS 401-874-7993. **We do not have respirators in the lab, so for most spills out of the fume hood it is not safe to clean them up yourself**
- If the spill is of something non-vaporous, and only slightly hazardous (health hazard of 1) because it is a skin irritant or similarly minimal risk, it can be cleaned up with paper towels and proper PPE
- If the spill is small and in the fume hood, you can use our chemical spill kit to neutralize and clean the spill. Look at the [Chemical Spill Kit Guide](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/Documents/Spill-Kit-Treatment-Guide.pdf) for reference of what chemicals they can be used on
- For acid spills (HCl) use Spill-X-A
- For caustic (basic) spills (NaOH) use Spill-X-C
- For solvent spills (acetone, methanol, isopropanol, chloroform) use Spill-X-S
- For Tri-Reagent or Trizol (Phenol) spills, use sodium bicarbonate
- For formalin or zinc buffered formalin use the polyform container also in cabinet J10
- When using any of the spill kit solids, pour them in a circle around the spill then over the spill. Use the paddle in the spill kit to mix the liquid with the solids. For complete neutralization, there should no longer be liquids and the substances should be solidified
- Use a dustpan to scrape the neutralized solid into one of the hazardous waste bags in the spill kit. Label appropriately and dispose of in the solid waste bag
- When in doubt, call EHS about any spill
- Do not try to clean up acetonitrile or beta-mercaptoethanol spills yourself, call EHS
- Report the spill to the lab manager and your PI and decided if an [Incident Report Form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/incident-reporting-form/) needs to be filled out

**Personal Exposure**
- Depending on the exposure, decide how to cleanse yourself
- If in or around the eye area, go to the eye-wash station and flush your eyes for 10-15 minutes. The alarm will go off when the eye-wash is activated. If pain or irritation still persists, seek medical attention rapidly. Contact your doctor for any level of exposure, and have the SDS ready to give to them
- If it is an exposure on the hands or wrists, wash in the sink with soap and water for 15 minutes. Contact medical attention if necessary and have the SDS for the chemical ready to give to them
- For large exposures, use the safety shower. Remove all clothing necessary to rinse the effected area. Rinse for 10-15 minutes. For large exposures, contact EHS, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention somehow
- If there is any question about how you feel after a small exposure, err on the side of seeking medical attention
- **For all exposures, tell the lab manager/lab captain and your PI. Multiple forms need to be filled out within 24 hours of a personal chemical exposure:**
  - **An [Incident Report Form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/incident-reporting-form/) from EHS**
  - **For an EMPLOYEE a [State of Rhode Island Initial Incident Report Form](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/Documents/RI-State-Initial-Injury-Report.pdf) needs to be filled out within 24 hours. This needs to be filled out with a supervisor (PI) as well as the person affected. Undergad students working over the summer are considered employees. This needs to be scanned and sent to urihr@ucs.uri.edu, and cc plmccarthy@uri.edu, as well as your PI**
  - **For a STUDENT a [State of Rhode Island Student Accident Report Form](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/Documents/Student-Accident-Report-Form-4-8-141.pdf) needs to be filled out within 24 hours. Graduate students are considered students. This needs to be scanned and sent to phallagan@uri.edu and cc your PI**
  - **If someone WITNESSES the accident, they need to fill out the [Witness Report of Accident Form](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/Documents/Witness-Form.pdf). Scan and send this in the email sent either to urihr@ucs.uri.edu or plmccarthy@uri.edu**

1. Pick one of the very hazardous chemicals from the list above and find the SDS online. List the physical, health, flammable, and instability hazard class. Also identify and list all the health risks if exposed, and first aid measures.
2. Go to our solid chemical list and pick the 11th chemical. Provide the SDS link, and the catalog number for re-order. Also list the physical, health, flammable, and instability hazard class. 
3. Why should you never work in the lab alone when using very hazardous chemicals?
4. Go to the [waste pickup form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/online-pickup/) and familiarize yourself with the form. Fill in some hypothetical waste to be picked up and screen shot it
5. What would you do if someone else working in the lab spills something very hazardous on themselves and it is only you two in the lab?
