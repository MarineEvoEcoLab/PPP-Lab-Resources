# Safety Trainings Required in the PPP Labs

## These MUST be Completely Before Starting Work in the Lab

- **Lab Safety Walkthough/Checklist (in-person on first day)**
- **CITI Responsible Conduct of Research**
- **PPP Chemical and Waste Training**
- **CITI Lab Chemical Safety Training**

## Training Specifics

### Lab Safety Walkthough/Checklist

- This walks you through where all the PPE, safety showers, first aid, SDS, chemicals, SSAs, etc. are in the lab
- The student mentoring you/PI, or senior lab member will do this with you on your first day coming into the lab

### CITI Trainings

**How to sign up for CITI trainings**  
- Follow [these guidelines](https://web.uri.edu/research-admin/office-of-research-integrity/ori-training/citi-program/) for registering/getting a login. Note that it's University of Rhode Island you type in, without the 'The'.
- Go to **My Courses** by clicking on the top bar
- Click **View Courses** next to University of Rhode Island
- Scroll to the bottom to **Learner Tools for University of Rhode Island** and select **Add a Course**
- In Question 2, select **RCR for Biomedical Researchers**
- In Question 10, select **Laboratory Chemical Safety**
- You can also select **Compressed Gases Safety** to do separately from the Lab Chemical Safety, if you don't do it separately, they will include it in the general training
- Scroll to the bottom and select submit

**Laboratory Chemical Safety**

- This will take **2 hours to complete, at least**, please give yourself adequate time/go back to modules you haven't completed
- I would suggest selecting to take **Classic** mode, where everything is text for you to read. Audio/visual mode is entirely videos, which may take you longer
- The modules on "Transporting Hazardous Chemicals" and "Chemical Security" are **not** required. We do not ship hazardous chemicals, and we do not have concerns about security in our lab. You still have to take them to complete the certification, but if you get 0/0 on the quiz that's no big deal
- **The most important thing is that you read/listen to the training and understand the information.** Some of the quiz questions are very specific on legal things or government departments. Those are not as important as understanding lab, chemical, and waste safety. Getting 100% on each quiz is not required, but please **take the time to read through this fully, it will make you a better scientist**

**RCR, Responsible Conduct of Research**
- This will also take you some time to complete so give yourself a good amount of time for it
- Not all of the content is completely relevant to our labs, but the concepts of conducting responsible research are **crucial**
- Understanding how to conduct research responsibly will make you and the lab members around you better scientists and colleagues

**Compressed Gases Safety**
- This can be done separately if you would like, or it is included in the Lab Chemical Safety as the final module
- If you have done the Lab Chemical Safety, and you have also signed up for this, it will show as "completed already" when you try to go to it through the portal
- If you do it before you do the Lab Chemical Safety, then it will be one less module to do in that one

When you are done with a training, Click **access your competion records**. Then select **view/print completion report**, save this report and use it to upload to the [PPP Training google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-GkvKIAPjyHMYcQwfDuoZZfON_4pJW19Htjad9_6jw3S_nw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Make sure you select the **report** option so scores are reported.

### [PPP Chemical and Waste Training](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/Chemical-and-Waste-Lab-Training-Info.md)
- This is specifics on chemicals in our lab, where they are, and how to dispose of things, and what to do in emergencies
- **Please go back to this document!!!** It has the links to all the chemicals in the lab, links to necessary EHS info, pictograms, forms to fill out if there is a chemical exposure, etc
- **This is where a list of all very dangerous chemicals in our lab is. It is your right as an employee to know what hazardous chemicals are in your workplace**
- Respond to the questions at the end of the document and record them as a doc or a PDF. Upload that to the [PPP Lab Training Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-GkvKIAPjyHMYcQwfDuoZZfON_4pJW19Htjad9_6jw3S_nw/viewform?usp=sf_link)


## Liquid Nitrogen Training

#### If you are going to use our LN2 tanks, you MUST go through an extra training online, as well as have a senior lab member go through using the tank with you the first time you use it. If you are using dry shippers, you must have someone fill it with you the first time you are working with one.

**Go through the [PPP Specific Liquid Nitrogen Safety, Training, and Facts File](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Lab_Safety_and_Training/LN2-Safety-Traning.md), and record your answers to the questions in a doc or PDF and attach to the [PPP Training Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-GkvKIAPjyHMYcQwfDuoZZfON_4pJW19Htjad9_6jw3S_nw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

This has information about how we use liquid nitrogen in our lab, what materials we have here to work with it, and how to use the specific tanks we get. This is meant to be a safety training as well as a guide on how to use our tanks.

#### You also must get an 80 or 100% grade on the Compressed Gas Safety section of the CITI training to be cleared to work with LN2.
